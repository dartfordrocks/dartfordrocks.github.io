<h3 style="font-family:sans-serif;font-size:200%">APRIL FOOL!</h3>
<i>April 1 2017, 12:00</i><br><br>
    <p style="font-family:Sans-serif;font-size:150%">
    Yes, this was an April Fool joke, pretty obvious by the time you get to the Kite kites picture, another to add to the 'fun' that happens this time of year - I hope you got a few seconds of amusement from it!<br><br>
    
        <a href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserPage.action?userUrl=progers&pageUrl=4" target="_blank" title="Link opens in a new window"><img src="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/giving/Images/banners/261x88_donate.png" border="0" alt="Make a donation using Virgin Money Giving"></a><br>
        
    On a more serious note: I'll be running the London Marathon on April 22nd, so if you found this amusing, or any of other stuff I've done around town (trains!!), then why not sponsor me and give some well deserving charities some money. If you'd like to then <a href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/fundraiser-web/fundraiser/showFundraiserPage.action?userUrl=progers&pageUrl=4">please follow this link and donate some money</a>, no matter how small - your donation will be appreciated!<br><br>
        
    I'm also attempting to <a href="http://phil.run">blog the run up to the event</a> and shortly after...if I get time to!<br><br>
        
    Also if there are any community groups/not for profit organisations that would like to take over the <b>dartford.rocks</b> domain from June 2017 onwards - get in contact with me: <a href="mailto:mail@dartford.rocks">mail@dartford.rocks</a>

    <h3 style="font-family:sans-serif;font-size:200%">Celebrating the achievements of Dartford Council!</h3>
    <i>April 1 2017, 09:00</i><br><br>
    <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;font-size:150%">
    
For one day only, we are offering families a free kite to celebrate the achievements of Dartford Council, and to also to go some way to address the rise in Council Tax that starts today!
    <br><br>
    Please bring your latest Council Tax bill, which we will stamp once you collect your free kite.<br><br>

    <br><br>
    
Come on down to Central Park and pick up your free DBC branded kite this morning before noon, and enjoy the park and all its glory, before they are overshadowed by houses in the next few years.
    <br><br>
    
Your kite will soar higher than any other kite, and is made from the finest materials.  <br><br>Show your appreciation for the Council and all their achievements, and fly your kite with pride!<br><br>
   <img src="kites.png" width=100%>     <br><br>
Remember - you wouldn't get this at any other Council!
